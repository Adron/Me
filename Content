Junction(Link)
August 2013
Junction - Windows 8 Interface for administration, management and data manipulation of Riak Clusters.

Features - this is the shortlist of what the project is aiming for:

Call the Doctor! (Administration & Maintenance) This part of the application would provide an interface for all the general administration and maintenance needs around individual nodes and around the overall cluster of nodes. The ability to add, remove and generally administer everything that is available via the riak-admin command line interface.

Time Travel That Data (Performance Benchmarking) This section of the application will provide the ability to benchmark the timing of data in and out of a cluster. In addition it should show standard benchmarking similar to that which is offered with the basho_bench project.

Love of the Data (Reporting) This division of the application would be focused on reporting. I'm not sure what exactly that would entail, but something with charts, graphs and pulling together trending points of some sort. If you have ideas and want to work on this part of the application, weigh in!

Golfing With Your Data (Query, Put, Deletes, Etc. Handling the CRUD) The application will have an interface to provide access to add and remove data, as well as viewing the data that is available within a cluster. The primary means for implementing this part of the application will be with the CorrugatedIron Project. It's a library available via Nuget that @peschkaj and @OJ have put together.

News! News! News! (News... RSS Feed Reader) The idea is that this will provide a quick and easy way to get familiar with Windows 8 dev and the project overall. I'm aiming to eat the Basho blog feed and provide it as key highlights for the application with future abilities around mining other RSS feeds or such and having those fed into a ?? Riak Cluster? Again, everything is open to change, addition or removal! So jump into the project and let me know your thoughts.less

Advice for Contacting Adron
I no longer answer phone calls without previously meeting someone or making arrangements via email or other easily queued electronic format. I do this, only because the volume of people contacting me without regard for the communication and point of message has overwhelmed my ability to answer these messages on point and without frustration. So please use email to contact me, and I'll respond to your message as soon as I possibly can.

Thanks!

I worked with Adron on a few New Relic plugins for Riak monitoring. He managed the project and directly interacted with the NR team to coordinate the marketing and publication of the plugins. We were well recognized in the community and internally at Basho for the work, and I'd be happy to work with him again in the future!

I had the privilege to work with Adron at Tier3. Both of us worked together in a team that brought IronFoundry to the market and eventually moved over to product management. Adron is a very intelligent and capable individual with a very good mastery of new technologies, in addition to being a phenomenal blogger...:) I really enjoyed working with him.

Adron exemplifies the best combination of technical excellence and business confidence that we strived to install across our engineering team at Tier 3. His technical knowledge of the cloud services segment and trends was critical in our product decision making process. Definite asset to our efforts.
