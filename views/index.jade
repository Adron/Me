              h3 Breaking it down...
              p I'm a Coder, have been for many years and I love coding. I've taken dives into everything from C# on large scale enterprise apps, ported scaled security systems in Java to other languages, slung C, C++ and Objective-C on projects and surfed the web building JavaScript Apps. The list goes on and on as I'm super passionate about coding, but what I focus on and am skilled at only starts there.
              p I'm a Messenger, in the sense that I've been in roles as advocate, evangelists or 'the super excited guy' because I am interested, driven and like to get intimately involved in technology, implementation and seeing the big picture of how the technology - software or hardware - affects us day to day. In this way I advocate and build systems, content, documentation even to bring knowledge to those that seek to build our future!
              p I'm Recon, I scope out, read voraciously, learning always, watching for queues and market shifts, new inventions and how they'll tie together for the next innovation. I like to get involved and stay involved at hackathons, with other companies in partnerships and bringing engineering efforts together.
              p.lead ...and that's just the high level!

                        p I've setup a company to work with startups and small businesses with getting the right architecture, build and deployed product into place. I've pushed this business forward using lean startup approaches, focused on quality, user experience, and putting together teams that can get products built and deployed.
                        p My focus and customer base has been startups in the very early stages of funding with early stage funding such as seed or A series, and small businesses working to grow their client base.
                        p My approach has been technology neutral; However the technology frameworks used focused on; node.js for simple services, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript using jQuery and related libraries for UI, mobile UI, and related multi-tier web development.

                        p I joined Tier 3 in March to lead the Web Fabric PaaS Team, expand the Iron Foundry Community (http://www.ironfoundry.org/) and push forward the Thor Projects (http://www.ironfoundry.org/thor).
                        p The initial release of the Tier 3 Web Fabric was deployed in May (http://www.tier3.com/blog/web-data-fabric). After the release I have focused primarily around advocacy, community leadership around the Iron Foundry Open Source Software Projects and initiating, building and leading the team that is coding the Thor Project as a UI for Cloud Foundry PaaS Environments.
                        p In addition to these efforts I also routinely speak at user groups, keynotes, or other groups and lead community efforts around mentoring, teaching and expanding programming practice and knowledge in several cities including Seattle, Portland, San Francisco and generally anywhere I can get to and organize events.
