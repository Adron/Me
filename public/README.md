Just a little readme to describe the mess that is the css, images and js directories.

In the css directory there are several directories:

* font - The Font Awesome & other font related svg, ttf, eot, woff and other files.
* less - Font Awesome based css around less.
* smoothness - This is the directory used to store all of the custom jquery UI css using the 'smoothness' theme.

In the root of the css directory some notable files are...

* font-awesome...* - whatever files are the ones used to implement the font awesome capabilities. If you're curous do a search on 'font awesome' and you'll find plenty of material on the ole' internet.
* prettyPhoto.css - This file is currently unused, but one of the slick features of the theme uses this css to handle image thumbnail and other related rendering.
* proudify.min.css - this file is related to the rendering of the Coder Wall badges.
* theme-oranges.css - this file is the main css content for the overall site - based on the theme forest template called '...' <- I've got to add that to the readme, I've forgotten the file.
